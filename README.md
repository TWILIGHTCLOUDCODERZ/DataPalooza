# Project Work flow

To run a Node.js application in a web browser, you typically cannot run the Node.js server code directly in the browser because browsers don't have the ability to execute server-side JavaScript. Instead, you need to run the Node.js server on a server machine, and then connect to it from the browser

### `npm install snowflake-sdk`

## Snowflake Connection Options:
const connectionOptions = {
  account: 'your_ACCOUNT',
  username: 'your_username',
  password: 'your_PASSWORD',
  warehouse: 'your_warehouse',
  database: 'your_database',
  schema: 'your_schema',
};`


## Running the Node.js Application:

<BR>
### `npm install`
Run the Server:Execute the following command to start your Node.js server:
